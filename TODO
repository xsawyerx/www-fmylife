list of stuff that needs be done, hopefully organized by stable releases:
(this is just a quick roadmap, so much of this might change)

0.01:
    - finish minimum test coverage
    - add warning that API might still change

0.02:
    - cover main objects and attributes

0.03:
    - cover main methods

0.04:
    - increase test coverage (Devel::Cover can help)
    - add documentation
    - prepare for 1st stable release

0.05:
    - refactor code as much as possible
    - try to get to 100% support of API
    - helper functions
