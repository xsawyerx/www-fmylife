list of stuff that needs be done, hopefully organized by stable releases:
(this is just a quick roadmap, so much of this might change)

General TODO stuff:
- use URI type constraint on api_url attribute
- use File::Spec for paths
- Moose meta make immutable
- finish minimum test coverage
- add tests for top (with the option to get page number)
- cover main methods
- increase test coverage (Devel::Cover can help)
- try to get to 100% support of API
- helper functions
- once stable, submit to FML API applications

0.04:
