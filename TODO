    - add tests for random
    - add tests for top (with the option to get page number)
    - add warning that API might still change

0.02:
    - cover main objects and attributes

0.03:
    - cover main methods

0.04:
    - increase test coverage (Devel::Cover can help)

    - prepare for 1st stable release

0.05:
    - refactor code as much as possible
    - try to get to 100% support of API
