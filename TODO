list of stuff that needs be done, hopefully organized by stable releases:
(this is just a quick roadmap, so much of this might change)

General TODO stuff:
- use URI type constraint on api_url attribute
- use File::Spec for paths
- Moose meta make immutable
- finish minimum test coverage
- add to last() the option to get a page number
- add tests for random
- add tests for top (with the option to get page number)
- add warning that API might still change
- cover main objects and attributes
- cover main methods
- increase test coverage (Devel::Cover can help)
- add documentation
- prepare for 1st stable release
- refactor code as much as possible
- try to get to 100% support of API
- helper functions
- pagers with next() and previous() for pages
- once stable, submit to FML API applications
