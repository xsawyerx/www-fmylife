I most definitely see your point, Novelist, but personally I wouldn't run around shirtless because it IS thought as highly sexual; Not because I don't want to "indecently" expose myself, but because I'm a'feared of what could happen to me should I choose to.</text></comment><comment id="3528262" in_reply_to="19" pub_id="125" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">4ube</author><date>2009-08-13T08:17:47-04:00</date><text>Breast are secondary sexual organs, as much as beard, hair on torso. secondary sexual organs is what differenciates a male from a female, except from what's between your legs.

That tends to lead to it being inappropriate for them to be shown in most civilised cultures.

Is it fair? Probably not.

I think people should be less picky about ALL sexual organs being exposed. However, while we are covering them. Tits counts. Moobs however are the little breasts that couldn't and never really made it to have sort of sexual function.

FYI, breasts sexual functions actually are quite broad. Fat stores for emergencies during pregnancy, feeding babies, arrosal and sexual gratification and that last one is for both women AND men :P</text></comment><comment id="3539308" in_reply_to="19" pub_id="154" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">LeCielNousAide</author><date>2009-08-14T00:47:53-04:00</date><text>I agree on the logic that it's not fair that women have to cover themselves up when men don't...but i see it in a reverse logic. men AND women should be required to wear shirts, not both allowed to go topless. the one thing i hate about the beach and pools is all the fat men running around with no shirts. nobody wants to see that. my dad always wears a shirt in the water -- it's not that big a deal. plus, it protects against sunburn.

to the OP: FYL indeed, but the 15 year old totally should have had a shirt on. nobody wants to see a fat dude shirtless.</text></comment><comment id="3542408" in_reply_to="19" pub_id="157" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">nutella89</author><date>2009-08-14T07:42:21-04:00</date><text>I love the cliché that the whole world has that people in Europe are always topless and are nymphos and talk about sex all the time.

It's a functional organ used biologically for providing nourishment for babies. In countries not heavily influenced by western civilization, it's common for women to bare their chests like the men of their culture. 

The idea of forcing women to cover up for fear of arousing men is not unlike the practice of forcibly wearing a burqa.</text></comment><comment id="3523406" pub_id="20" staff="0"><author photo="http://cdn.betacie.com/fmylife/data/en/membres/mid/f7aa16da79f0e8229d5f27191258e992.jpg" url="">bdaniels362</author><date>2009-08-12T22:00:38-04:00</date><text>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Today, my friends and I went to the waterpark. Unfortunately, one of my friends couldn't come because we can't all fit in the car ( I take up two seats ). Anyway, we were having fun but I kept noticing that people were staring and whispering. It got worse when I went into the wave pool. To top it all off, a person who worked there came over and told me that girls aren't allowed to go topless and to cover up. I'm a boy... FML

This fml was not made to offend overweight people, and I apologize if it did. I truly sympathize with people who take up two car seats, and get mistaken as women because of their man boobs.</text></comment><comment id="3524286" pub_id="55" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">fmh123</author><date>2009-08-12T23:04:59-04:00</date><text>now thats funny, the kid so fat he looks like he has boobs</text></comment><comment id="3525085" in_reply_to="56" pub_id="77" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">hannahMlover_not</author><date>2009-08-13T00:19:00-04:00</date><text>other ppl thought he was a girl too</text></comment><comment id="3524405" pub_id="58" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">iFruit</author><date>2009-08-12T23:16:13-04:00</date><text> Cheeseburgerplz, clearly the fat kid did look like a girl as other people were complaining too.</text></comment><comment id="3524419" pub_id="59" staff="0"><author photo="" url="">SirAwesome</author><date>2009-08-12T23:17:25-04:00</date><text>FYL for having to look at a 15 year old with manboobs!</text></comment><comment id="3524460" pub_id="60" staff="0"><author photo="http://cdn.betacie.com/fmylife/data/en/membres/mid/7d36085c0621fdb70f83eda5353fb487.jpg" url="">snowflake19</author><date>2009-08-12T23:21:17-04:00</date><text>Haha, now THAT'S an FML XD</text></comment><comment id="3524485" pub_id="61" staff="0"><author photo="http://cdn.betacie.com/fmylife/data/en/membres/mid/d772ee5ef2283ff909b59c01162c572a.jpg" url="">wordgirl</author><date>2009-08-12T23:23:41-04:00</date><text>Manboobies.
